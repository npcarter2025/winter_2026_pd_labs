# Winter 2026 Physical Design Labs

Repository for UCSC physical design course labs.

## Directory Structure

Each lab is organized as follows:

```
labX/
├── original/   # Professor's original files (unchanged backup)
├── work/       # Working directory for lab exercises
└── final/      # Final submission materials
```

## Labs

- **lab1**: HSPICE Inverter Characterization
- **lab2**: TBD

## Notes

- `.gitignore` is configured to exclude HSPICE output files (.log, .rpt, .db, etc.)
- Keep original files pristine for reference
- All work should be done in the `work/` subdirectories
