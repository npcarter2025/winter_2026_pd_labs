1. Simulation of an Inverter cell of size 4x with process technology of 7nm.

   Run the spice simulation using command 

     -> hspice -i invx4_tt0p65v-40c.spi -o invx4_tt0p65v-40c_out

       Ignore error of " **error** invalid memory reference"
   Refer measurement files (*.mt*) to know delay and transition time.

To view spice waveform use command
   	wv  <filename>_out.tr* , where * can be any number

   
   Q1.1: Submit two plots with   (20 pts)
   	  a. input slew on X axis, rise_delay on Y axis, fall_delay on secondary Y axis
	  b. input slew on X axis, rise_tr on Y axis, fall_tr on secondary Y axis
   
   Q1.2: Rerun the simulation with cload of 5ff, 10ff, 20ff & 25ff by changing
value of cload paramater (i.e. .param cload = ) in invx4_tt0p65v-40c.spi and 
submit two plots with ( 20 pts)
	Use the command 
		hspice -i invx4_tt0p65v-40c_load_sweep.spi

	a. Output load on X axis, rise_delay on Y axis, fall_delay on secondary Y axis
	b. Output load on X axis, rise_tr on Y axis, fall_tr on secondary Y axis

You can draw plot on paper and send picture of it.
Do not spend time on graphing plot.


2. Answer the below question
 
 Q2.1  Is both rise & fall delay are increasing with rising of output load & input slew?  ( 10 points )

 Q2.2 Is timing arc from input pin to outpin of inverter is inverting arc, non-inverting arc or nonunate? (10 points)

 Q2.3 Read Liberty model of a standard cell library at 

/usr/synopsys/SAED_EDK32_28nm/SAED32_EDK/lib/stdcell_rvt/db_nldm/saed32rvt_ss0p75vn40c.lib 

and tell value of nom_proccess, nom_voltage & nom_temperature?  (10 points)

 Q2.4 Read LEF model of a standard cell library at

/usr/synopsys/SAED_EDK32_28nm/SAED32_EDK/lib/stdcell_rvt/lef/saed32nm_rvt_1p9m.lef

and give answer of below questions  ( 30 points)
	->  write boundary size ( width X height) of TNBUFFX2_RVT cell
	-> How many & which layers are used insed TNBUFFX32_RTVT
	-> Give name of all power signals which used for all Cells?
	-> What is "OBS" in LEF file and why it is being spefied in LEF?
